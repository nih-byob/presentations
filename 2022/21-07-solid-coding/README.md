Did you ever wonder if there is a way to organise your code better? Do you struggle 

The [SOLID principles](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) 
represent 5 different principles that assist in achieving more flexible and robust software when applied on the mid-level architecture in a software application.

They have been collected by Robert C. Martin (aka Uncle Bob) and represent important tools to have in
your developer's toolkit.

The SOLID principles are discussed in more detail in Robert Martin's book _Clean Architecture_ (see listing below).
