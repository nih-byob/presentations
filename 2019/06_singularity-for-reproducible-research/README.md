## Creating Writable Containers
I wasn't able to go into this due to time, but if you want a space to be able test out the commands needed to install software into your container,
you can try creating a sandbox directory.

There is a way to convert your sandbox to the default squashfs image file but this is not considered good practice as you will not have the full documentation of how your container was made.

The recommended workflow would be test out your commands in a writable container. Then copy the commands that work to the necessary sections in the recipe file.
