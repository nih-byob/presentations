Bioinformatic approaches for proteogenomics
===========================================

Proteogenomic research seeks to relate findings from genomic data to proteomic data and
vice versa.  Some common analyses include: identifying novel peptides predicted by
genomic variants or correlating gene expression with protein abundance. NCIâ€™s Clinical
Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) is characterizing and analyzing the
proteomes and genomes of multiple tumor types.  Dr. Kinsinger will provide an overview
of the proteogenomic field as well as describe available data resources and software
tools.
